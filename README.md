# Finance Data Retrieval Project
This project is designed to retrieve financial data from the Alpha Vantage API. The project is structured to keep the main functionality separate from modular components for better maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure
Main Directory: The core functionality of the project, including the main script to run the data retrieval process.
Modules (finance_data): This directory contains modular scripts and functions used to interact with the Alpha Vantage API, handle data processing, and any other specific tasks related to finance data retrieval.
